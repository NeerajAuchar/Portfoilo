                                    <p> Our Project created aims to help reduce the potential spread of the disease by
                                        utilizing an ultrasonic distance sensor. The sensor measures the distance
                                        between itself and the object in front of it, whether it be an object or a
                                        person. If something comes within
                                        100 cm of the sensor, a buzzer sounds, and an LED lights up, therefore signaling
                                        that someone or something is within the range of social distancing

                                   <p>In this Arduino Tutorial we will learn how to control DC motors using Arduino. We well take a look at some basic techniques for controlling DC motors and make two example through which we will learn how to control DC motors using the L298N motor
                                    Driver and Arduino board. A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electric motors that converts direct current (DC) electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current in part of the motor. We will divide it into three parts –
                                    •	Just make your motor spin
                                    •	Control motor speed
                                    •	Control the direction of the spin of DC motor
                                    There are several types of DC motors, but here we will use a simple brushed DC motor.  It has small plastic gears and is quite easy to drive. This motor is suitable for small robots and toys In this circuit, the adjustable Power supply can be replaced with a  battery or power adapter. Make sure all wires and cables are connected correctly and then upload the code.
                                    In this circuit, the adjustable Power supply can be replaced with a  battery or power adapter. Make sure all wires and cables are connected correctly and then upload the code, we will use L298N motor driver. The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver which allows speed and direction control of two DC motors at the same time. The module can drive DC motors that have voltages between 5 and 35V, with a peak current up to 2A.

                                    <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In this project, we used a simple brushed DC motor. This motor is suitable for small robots and toys. In this circuit, the adjustable Power supply can be replaced with a  battery or power adapter

                                        In this project we also learned how to control DC motors by Arduino and L293D. We were able to control the Spinning direction, acceleration, speed, power and shaft position of the DC motor.
                                        
                                        To control the direction of the spin of DC motor, without interchanging the leads, we used a circuit called an H-Bridge.
                                        
                                        As a result, after executing the code we can observe that the motor will run first in the clockwise (CW) direction for 3 seconds and then counter-clockwise (CCW) for 3 seconds. The time span of rotation can be changed by changing the time interval in the code.
